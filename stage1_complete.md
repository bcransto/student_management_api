# Stage 1 Complete - Foundation with Undo System

## What Was Implemented:

### 1. **Undo/Redo State Management**
- Added `history` state array to track all assignment changes
- Added `historyIndex` to track current position in history
- Created `addToHistory()` function to record changes with descriptions
- Created `handleUndo()` function to revert to previous state
- Added `canUndo` and `canRedo` computed values

### 2. **Fill Mode State**
- Added `fillMode` state with default value "random"
- Three modes available: "random", "matchGender", "balanceGender"

### 3. **UI Updates**
- **Undo Button**: Added to toolbar, shows yellow when available, displays tooltip with last action
- **Fill Section**: Renamed from "Auto-Fill Options" to "Fill"
- **Mode Dropdown**: Added dropdown selector with three fill modes
- **Kept existing buttons**: Temporarily kept for backwards compatibility

### 4. **History Tracking Integration**
All assignment changes now use the history system:
- `handleSeatAssignment()` - tracks "Place [Student Name]"
- `handleSeatSwap()` - tracks "Swap [Student A] and [Student B]"  
- `handleSeatUnassignment()` - tracks "Remove [Student Name]"

## Testing Stage 1:

1. **Navigate to**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/#seating
2. **Select**: Blue class
3. **Click**: Edit button

You should see:
- Yellow "Undo" button in toolbar (grayed out initially)
- "Fill" section in sidebar with Mode dropdown
- Existing autofill buttons still present

Test the undo:
1. Drag a student to a seat
2. Undo button becomes yellow
3. Hover shows "Undo: Place [Student Name]"
4. Click Undo - student returns to pool
5. Try swapping students and undoing

## Console Messages:
- "Fill mode changed to: [mode]" when dropdown changes
- "History: Added [action], stack size: N" for each action
- "Undo: [action]" when undoing

## Ready for Stage 2:
The foundation is complete. Next stage will implement click-to-fill functionality using the selected fill mode.
