# Stage 4 Testing - Auto Button (Batch Fill)

## What Was Implemented:

### Auto Button Functionality
The Auto button now fills ALL empty seats at once according to the selected fill mode:

1. **Batch Operation**: 
   - Fills all empty seats in one operation
   - Creates a single undo entry for the entire batch
   - Shows description like "Auto-fill 12 seats (random)"

2. **Mode-Specific Behavior**:
   - **Random**: Shuffles unassigned students and places randomly
   - **Match Gender**: Processes seats sequentially, matching neighbors
   - **Balance Gender**: Alternates genders to maintain balance

3. **Safety Checks**:
   - Skips occupied seats
   - Skips deactivated (red) seats
   - Alerts if no empty seats or no students available

## Testing Instructions:

Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/#seating â†’ Blue class â†’ Edit

### Test 1: Random Auto-Fill
1. Clear some/all seats (Reset button)
2. Select "Random" from Fill dropdown
3. Click "Auto" button
4. All empty seats should fill randomly
5. Console: "Auto-fill complete: Placed X students"
6. Undo button shows: "Undo: Auto-fill X seats (random)"

### Test 2: Match Gender Auto-Fill
1. Reset to clear seats
2. Manually place a few students of same gender
3. Select "Match Gender" mode
4. Click "Auto"
5. Should create clusters of same gender
6. Turn on Gender view to verify patterns (blue/green clusters)

### Test 3: Balance Gender Auto-Fill
1. Reset to clear seats
2. Select "Balance Gender" mode
3. Click "Auto"
4. Should create alternating pattern
5. Turn on Gender view to see checkerboard-like pattern
6. Console shows: "Balance Gender: X males, Y females, Z unknown"

### Test 4: Partial Fill
1. Place some students manually
2. Block some seats (Shift+click to make red)
3. Click "Auto"
4. Should only fill empty, non-blocked seats
5. Respects existing placements and blocked seats

### Test 5: Single Undo for Batch
1. After any auto-fill
2. Click Undo once
3. ALL students placed by auto-fill should return to pool
4. Not individual undos - entire batch in one action

### Test 6: Edge Cases
1. **No empty seats**: Fill all manually, then click Auto
   - Alert: "No empty seats to fill!"
2. **No students left**: Auto-fill, then click Auto again
   - Alert: "No unassigned students available!"
3. **More seats than students**: Auto-fill with limited pool
   - Fills what it can, leaves rest empty

## Console Messages:
- "Starting auto-fill with mode: [mode]"
- "Found X empty seats to fill"
- "Auto-fill complete: Placed X students"
- For Balance Gender: "Balance Gender: X males, Y females, Z unknown"

## Visual Verification:
1. Use Gender view mode to verify patterns:
   - Random: Mixed distribution
   - Match Gender: Clustered groups
   - Balance Gender: Alternating pattern

2. Check the student pool:
   - Should be empty or nearly empty after auto-fill
   - Students return to pool on undo
