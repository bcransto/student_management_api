# Stage 2 Testing - Click-to-Fill (Random Mode)

## What Was Implemented:

### Click-to-Fill Functionality
1. **Empty Seat Detection**: Clicking on an empty seat now automatically assigns a student
2. **Random Selection**: Uses the "Random" fill mode to select from unassigned students  
3. **Safety Checks**:
   - Won't fill occupied seats
   - Won't fill deactivated (red) seats
   - Shows message if no unassigned students available
4. **History Integration**: Each click-to-fill action is tracked in undo history

### Visual Feedback
1. **Hover Effects** on empty seats:
   - Light blue becomes darker blue on hover
   - Slight scale increase (1.05x)
   - Cursor shows as pointer
2. **Deactivated Seats**: Show not-allowed cursor
3. **Fillable Class**: Added to empty, non-deactivated seats

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Navigate to**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/#seating
2. **Select**: Blue class  
3. **Click**: Edit button

### Test 1: Basic Click-to-Fill
1. Look for empty seats (light blue)
2. Hover over an empty seat - it should:
   - Turn darker blue
   - Grow slightly
   - Show pointer cursor
3. Click the empty seat
4. A random student from the pool should be placed
5. Check console for: "Random fill: Selected [Student Name]"

### Test 2: Undo Click-to-Fill
1. After clicking to fill a seat
2. Check the Undo button - should show "Undo: Place [Student Name]"
3. Click Undo
4. Student returns to pool

### Test 3: Fill Mode Dropdown
1. Check the "Fill" section in left sidebar
2. Dropdown should show "Random" selected
3. Change to "Match Gender" or "Balance Gender"
4. Click an empty seat
5. Console should show: "Fill mode [mode] not yet implemented, using random"

### Test 4: Safety Checks
1. **Occupied Seat**: Click a seat with a student - nothing should happen
2. **Deactivated Seat**: 
   - Shift+click to deactivate a seat (turns red)
   - Try clicking it normally - should not fill
3. **No Students Left**:
   - Fill all seats manually or with clicks
   - Try clicking an empty seat
   - Console: "No unassigned students available"

## Console Messages to Verify:
- "Normal click on seat [id]"
- "Random fill: Selected [Student Name]"  
- "Seat already occupied" (when clicking filled seat)
- "Cannot fill deactivated seat" (when clicking red seat)
- "No unassigned students available" (when pool is empty)
- "Fill mode [mode] not yet implemented, using random" (for other modes)

## Stage 2 Complete âœ…
Click-to-fill with random mode is working! Ready for Stage 3 to implement gender-aware modes.
