# Stage 3 Testing - Gender-Aware Fill Modes

## What Was Implemented:

### Gender-Aware Filling Modes

1. **Match Gender Mode**:
   - Looks at neighboring seats (seat numbers +/- 1)
   - Tries to place a student of the same gender as neighbors
   - Falls back to random if no matching gender available

2. **Balance Gender Mode**:
   - Tracks overall gender distribution in assigned seats
   - Selects students to balance male/female ratio
   - Prioritizes underrepresented gender

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `getNeighborGenders()`: Finds genders of adjacent students
   - `getGenderBalance()`: Counts current male/female distribution

## Testing Instructions:

Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/#seating → Blue class → Edit

### Test 1: Match Gender Mode
1. Select "Match Gender" from the Fill dropdown
2. Manually place a male student in seat 1
3. Click empty seat 2 (next to the male)
4. Should place another male student (if available)
5. Console shows: "Match Gender: Selected [Name] (M/male) to match neighbors"

### Test 2: Balance Gender Mode  
1. Select "Balance Gender" from Fill dropdown
2. Manually place several males (create imbalance)
3. Click an empty seat
4. Should place a female to balance
5. Console shows: "Balance Gender: Current balance: Male=X, Female=Y"
6. Continue clicking - should alternate to maintain balance

### Test 3: Edge Cases
1. **No neighbors** (Match Gender):
   - Click isolated seat with Match Gender mode
   - Falls back to random
   - Console: "No neighbors to match gender with, using random"

2. **No gender data**:
   - If students lack gender data, falls back to random
   - Works gracefully without errors

3. **All one gender left** (Balance Gender):
   - When only one gender remains in pool
   - Places available students regardless
   - Console: "No students of needed gender for balance, using random"

## Console Messages to Verify:

### Match Gender Mode:
- "Match Gender mode - Neighbor genders: [array]"
- "Match Gender: Selected [Name] ([gender]) to match neighbors"
- "No students of matching gender available, using random"
- "No neighbors to match gender with, using random"

### Balance Gender Mode:
- "Balance Gender mode - Current balance: Male=X, Female=Y"  
- "Balance Gender: Selected [Name] ([gender]) to balance distribution"
- "No students of needed gender for balance, using random"

## Visual Verification:

1. **With Gender Highlighting On**:
   - Switch view to "Gender" mode
   - Males show blue, Females show green
   - Verify Match Gender creates same-color clusters
   - Verify Balance Gender creates mixed pattern

2. **Undo Support**:
   - Each gender-aware placement can be undone
   - Undo button shows: "Undo: Place [Name]"

## Stage 3 Complete ✅

All three fill modes are now working:
- **Random**: Completely random selection
- **Match Gender**: Groups similar genders together
- **Balance Gender**: Maintains even distribution

Ready for Stage 4 (Auto button for batch filling)!
